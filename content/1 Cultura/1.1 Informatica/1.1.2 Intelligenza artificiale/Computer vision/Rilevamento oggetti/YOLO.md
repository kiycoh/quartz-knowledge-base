You Only Look Once è una serie di sistemi di rilevamento di oggetti in tempo reale basati su reti neurali convoluzionali. Introdotto per la prima volta da Joseph Redmon et al. nel 2015, YOLO ha subito numerose iterazioni e miglioramenti, diventando uno dei framework di rilevamento oggetti più popolari.0

## Versioni Yolo
**yolo v1,v2,v3** was by the person who introduced yolo himself -  Joseph Redmon:
- **v1 -** [**official paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)   
- **v2 -** [**official paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242)
- **v3 -** [**official paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02767) 

2020- he(Joseph Redmon ) anonnced that he was stepping away from computer vision research
meantime, **Glenn Jocher** (ultralytics company founder) unaffiliated with Joseph Redmon built a popular pytorch version of yolo v3 (the ones developed by Joseph Redmon was using darknet)
yolo v4 - Alexey Bochkovskiy published paper titling yolo v4 (for which Joseph Redmon (the one who created YOLO) acknowledged in this [tweet](https://x.com/1Sarim/status/1253514946110947328)) ,  v4 - [official paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934) of Alexey Bochkovskiy

yolo v5 - **Glenn Joche**r (ultralytics company founder)  upgraded the v3 version of his to the yolo v5 which was again a pytorch implementation. this gained a lot of popularity 

v5 -  **\[ this was not published officially \] ,** [repo](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)  
  
yolo v6 is said to be developed by "Meituan technical team"  
v6 -  **\[ paper wasn't published afaik \]**, [repo](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6) 

yolo v7 was again developed by the same team who did v4 and it was published (an another refreshed version also was published by the same team)

v7 - [official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02696) ,  [repo](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) 

yolo v8,v9,v10,v11 all were upgraded by Ultralytics itself from its previous versions \[ as far as i know
